## Course Overview
In this course, you will learn from leading AI experts about their insightful ideas. The course will cover their thoughts, beliefs, and concepts, including their risky but impactful ideas and what they believe but cannot yet prove. It will also discuss what they think will change the world and the biggest challenges they face.


## Grading breakdown:

* Participations: 30%
* Report 40%
* Idea Proposal: 30%

## Report
Students should submit a 1-page talk report after each talk by Friday at 5 PM. The report should include but not limited:
* Summary: A quick summary of the talk.
* Learned: What did you learn from the talk?
* Surprises: Any unexpected things you learned from the talk.
* Questions: Any questions you asked during or after the talk (if any).
* Additional Questions: 2-3 additional questions you would like to ask.

## Proposal for Idea (Team with up to 5 members)
After all talks, students should come up with project ideas and submit a proposal. Students can form a team with up to 5 members and are free to choose their teammates. This should include, but is not limited to:

To ensure a structured and impactful experience, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Problem Definition

Identify a Specific Issue: Clearly articulate a real-world problem that you aim to address using generative AI. This could range from enhancing educational tools to improving healthcare diagnostics. For example, "Developing an AI-driven platform to assist students with personalized study plans."

Assess the Scope and Impact: Evaluate how widespread the problem is and the potential benefits of solving it. Consider factors such as the number of individuals affected, economic implications, and societal benefits.

2. Solution Impact and Expected Outcomes

Define Positive Changes: Describe the tangible benefits your solution will bring. For instance, "Reducing study time by 30% through personalized learning paths."

Consider Long-Term Effects: Reflect on how your solution could evolve over time and its potential to inspire further innovations or improvements in related areas.

3. Utilized Generative AI Technologies and Models

Specify AI Tools and Models: Clearly state which generative AI models or tools you plan to use, such as GPT-4 for natural language processing or DALL·E for image generation.

Outline Application Strategies: Detail how you intend to integrate these technologies into your solution. For example, "Leveraging GPT-4 to generate personalized study materials based on individual learning styles."

4. Prototype Design and Visualization

Create a Visual Representation: Develop a prototype sketch on paper that illustrates the core features and user interface of your solution. This will help convey your concept effectively.

Include Key Elements: Ensure your sketch includes aspects like user interactions, data flow, and any AI components involved in the process.
